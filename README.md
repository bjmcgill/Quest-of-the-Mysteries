This is my first attempt at creating a text adventure using the python language and using Object Oriented Programming concepts. A lot of the code was created using GitHub Copilot so it might not be very stable at the moment. The first commit features two locations, a key and a sword. Picking up objects and dropping them is supported, as is moving between locations. You can save the game state and load it. This creates a JSON file. I use cmd library to create a command enry loop in which you can use the cursor keys to retrieve previous commands and edit them. I use shutil library to determine the terminal width and wordwrap to make the output fit the screen. I use ansi escape codes to add color to the output.

I think it will work on MacOS, Windows and Linux. Let me know if it doesn't. Happy Questing!
